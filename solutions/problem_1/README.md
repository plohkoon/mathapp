# Multiples of 3 or 5

This can be broken down into 3 steps:

1. The sum of the multiples of 3 less then the target
1. The sum of the multiples of 5 less then the target
1. The sum of the multiples of 15 less then the target

Then we can add (1) and (2) and subtract (3) to get our target sum.

## Sum of multiples of 3

The sum of multiples of 3 is `3 + 6 + ... = 3(1 + 2 + ...)` up to the next multiple of `3` below the target.

## Sum of multiples of 5

The sum of multiples of 3 is `5 + 10 + ... = 5(1 + 2 + ...)` up to the next multiple of `5` below the target.

## Sum of multiples of 15

The sum of multiples of 3 is `15 + 45 + ... = 15(1 + 2 + ...)` up to the next multiple of `15` below the target.
